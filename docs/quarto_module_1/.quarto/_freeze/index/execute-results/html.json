In this course, we will explore the management of ecological data using Program R. You will gain an in-depth understanding of how to apply [tidyverse packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) to efficiently wrangle ecological data.We will focus on the structure and linguistics of data in R, how to integrate R into a modern data science workflow, and explore how to think about ecological data in new ways.\n\n### Preliminary course content\n\nPrior to starting this module, I *strongly* suggest completing the preliminary course material. The lessons are designed to assist R beginners in getting a baseline familiarity with key R programming concepts and serve as an important refresher for those already working regularly in R. Even if you're coming in with *loads* of R experience, you'll almost certainly learn a thing or two along the way!\n\n-   [Lesson 1: Introduction to R and RStudio](https://smbc.shinyapps.io/L0-intro_RStudio/ \"https://smbc.shinyapps.io/L0-intro_RStudio/\")\n-   [Lesson 2: Values](https://smbc.shinyapps.io/L1-rValues/ \"https://smbc.shinyapps.io/L1-rValues/\")\n-   [Lesson 3: Objects](https://smbc.shinyapps.io/L2-rObjects/ \"https://smbc.shinyapps.io/L2-rObjects/\")\n-   [Lesson 4: Indexing](https://smbc.shinyapps.io/L3-indexing/#section-introduction \"https://smbc.shinyapps.io/4-indexing/#section-overview\")\n\n### What you will learn\n\nThis module is divided into seven sections:\n\n1.  **Course introduction**: A general introduction to the content of this course, where to find course resources, and how to navigate course content.\n2.  **Getting started**: This section provides [***necessary***]{style=\"color:red;\"} steps that you must take *prior* to completing the content of this module. Each module will begin with a section like this and the steps therein must be followed *carefully*!\n3.  **Importing, exploring, and exporting data**: How to read in different file formats, exploratory steps that should be taken *every time* you read in a file, and how to write files to your hard drive.\n4.  **Core *dplyr* verbs and when to use them**:\n5.  **Using the pipe for chained operations**:\n6.  **Introduction to data visualization with ggplot**\n7.  **Best practices in code formatting**:\n\nTo learn more about Quarto books visit <https://quarto.org/docs/books>.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/PCPTI0Pw76w?si=4xqDF8XuaJ1pGVF2 >}}\n\n",
